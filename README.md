# pyconvolve
Framework for convolution and deconvolution of three-dimensional image stacks.
This repository is released under the GPLv3. 

This framework was created within the scope of a Master's thesis at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf and the Helmholtz-Forschungsinstitut Jülich. Its purpose is to provide access to a general convolution and deconvolution suite to conduct in-silico experiments. 
It includes several deconvolution algorithms, simulation algorithms for PSF generation and algorithms for convolution. 
Everybody is welcome to clone the repository and use its content for academic and scientific work.
